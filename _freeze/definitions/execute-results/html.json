With *repositories* use alternative possibilities, such as keyword fields.\n  - e.g., which variables does the quantitative data set contain?\n  - e.g., which topics does your data cover?\n  - e.g., which population did you draw your sample from?\n\n### Accessible\n\n**The problem:**  \nJust because others find our data doesn't mean the *access barriers* are as low as possible and doesn't mean they know *in which way* they are allowed to access it. Examples:\n\n* Providing a link to the data in the text of a paywalled journal article\n* Unclear licensing / use conditions when providing data (e.g., are non-researchers allowed to access the data or is it only open for qualified researchers?)\n\n**The solutions:**\n\n* Make sure access is free of charge (or as cheap as possible)\n  - e.g., by providing link to data in publicly accessible sections of journal articles that are not open access\n  - e.g., by using repositories or research data centers that allow access free of charge\n* Make sure users know if they can access and under which conditions\n  - e.g., *research data centers* ensure that terms of use are clear (who may access under what conditions) and offer different levels of access restriction\n  - e.g., on *repositories* provide a readme-file and an open license (e.g., [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.de)) with data sets\n\n\n### Interoperable\n\n**The problem:**  \nJust because others downloaded our data doesn't mean they can open and manipulate it.\n\n**The solutions:**  \n\n* Use file formats with open licenses\n  - e.g., tabular data: CSV (with additional labelling script), RData\n  - e.g., text data: PDF, HTML, ODT, RTF\n* Make sure users know how different files are related to one another\n  - e.g., define which file contains student data and which teacher data\n  - e.g., define which file contains data from cohort 1 and which cohort 2, ...\n\n### Reusable\n\n**The problem:**  \nJust because others opened our data doesn't mean they understand the data and its use-conditions. Examples:\n\n* Others can't understand what the column names of the tabular data set mean: Which columns in the data set relate to which variables in the journal article?\n* Can someone from sociology use the data set from psychology they found on osf.io?\n* Does someone reusing a data set have to cite the authors?\n\n**The solutions:**  \n\n* Rich description/explanation of what user will find *in* the data set (`<svg preserveAspectRatio=\"none\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 448 512\" style=\"height:.8em;width:.8em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M369.8 37.4c14.7 9.8 18.7 29.7 8.9 44.4L337.1 144H400c17.7 0 32 14.3 32 32s-14.3 32-32 32H294.5l-64 96H400c17.7 0 32 14.3 32 32s-14.3 32-32 32H187.8l-65.2 97.7c-9.8 14.7-29.7 18.7-44.4 8.9s-18.7-29.7-8.9-44.4L110.9 368H48c-17.7 0-32-14.3-32-32s14.3-32 32-32H153.5l64-96H48c-17.7 0-32-14.3-32-32s14.3-32 32-32H260.2l65.2-97.7c9.8-14.7 29.7-18.7 44.4-8.9z\"/></svg>`{=html} meta descriptions about the dataset as a whole as for accessibility)\n* License\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\n## A good definition of \"open data\"\n\nIncludes aspects of fairness.
