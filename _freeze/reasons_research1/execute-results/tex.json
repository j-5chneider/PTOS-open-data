No data = not reproducible**\n\n*Computational reproducibility :=*  \n\n> \"a second investigator (including the original researcher in the future) can recreate the final reported results of the project, including key quantitative findings, tables, and figures, given only a set of files and written instructions”\n[@Kitzes.etal.2018, p. xxii]  \n  \nSame data + same analysis = same results\n\n\nAllows independent researchers to assess the analytic choices, assumptions, and implementations that led to a set of scientific claims -> check for validity an generalizability  \n[@Clyburne-Sherin.etal.2019; @Obels.etal.2020]\n\n\\\n\n**2.
