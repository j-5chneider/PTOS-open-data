# Research I

## Reproducibility & Replication

**1. No data = not reproducible**

*Computational reproducibility :=*  

> "a second investigator (including the original researcher in the future) can recreate the final reported results of the project, including key quantitative findings, tables, and figures, given only a set of files and written instructions”
[@Kitzes.etal.2018, p. xxii]  
  
Same data + same analysis = same results


Allows independent researchers to assess the analytic choices, assumptions, and implementations that led to a set of scientific claims -> check for validity an generalizability  
[@Clyburne-Sherin.etal.2019; @Obels.etal.2020]

\

**2. No FAIR data = reproducibility tedious**

But this isn't as easy as it sounds
[@Artner.etal.2021]

### Design

* checked 232 primary statistical claims
* from 3 journals
* after data was provided and accessible (33%, 25%, 26%)

### Results


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 15
#| fig-height: 9
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-dpi: 300

library(ggplot2)

artner <- data.frame(what = factor(c("scientific claims",
                                     "reproducible",
                                     "reproducible (strict)",
                                     "reproducible (strict) \n& procedure of paper"),
                                   levels = c("scientific claims",
                                     "reproducible",
                                     "reproducible (strict)",
                                     "reproducible (strict) \n& procedure of paper")),
                     count = c(232, 163, 137, 119),
                     percent = c("100 %", "70 %", "59 %", "51 %"))

ggplot(artner, aes(x=what, y=count)) +
  stat_summary(fun=mean, colour="#ff4c4c", geom="line", aes(group = 1), size = 3) +
  geom_point(size = 6) +
  annotate("text", x = artner$what, y = artner$count - 15, label = artner$percent, size = 6) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,235)) +
  xlab("") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 24))
```


### Conclusions

> Vagueness Makes Assessing Reproducibility a Nightmare  
> most successful reproductions are predominantly the result of tedious and time-consuming work
> information about the provided raw data was often difficult to understand, and information about the relevant variables, data manipulations, and the used statistical model was often vague or inaccurate

**3. No data = barrier to replication**  
Missing data are a major barrier to replication: data were open for 4 of 193 experiments [@Errington.etal.2021]
