## Informed consent
**Why?**  

* *Personal data* is subject to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* Informed consent must therefore fulfill a number of requirements. E.g.,
  - purpose of data collection (includes *sharing the data* and *future use*)<br />`r fontawesome::fa("right-long", height="1em", width="1em")` therefore often "broad consent"
  - participation is voluntary and without disadvantages
  - revocation is possible at any time (until anonymized)

## Decide for access restrictions
**Why?**  

* Some data *cannot or should not be anonymized* (e.g., losing their reuse potential)
   - Therefore access needs to be restricted to certain groups (as defined in consent form)
* Some researchers fear being *scooped* [@Laine.2017]

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon=false}
### With repositories...
restriction levels are usually limited to

* public (everybody sees everything)
* private (only you and your collaborators see everything)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon=false}
### With research data centers... 
there are different restriction levels possible for different files (*in the same project*). Restriction levels depend on what the research data center offers.

| Level              | Prerequesite                                                                                             | For what                                                         |   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---|

| Student Usefile    | Short application states use purpose                                                                     | non-anonymized data with right to use for teaching               |   |
| Scientific Usefile | Longer application states use purpose, handling of data, and data analyses; identification via PostIdent | non-anonymized data with right to use for research               |   |
| Remote Access      | ... + access only via virtual machine                                                                    | non-anonymized sensible data with right to use for research      |   |
| Safe room          | ... + access only in person at research institute                                                        | non-anonymized very sensible data with right to use for research |   |

An example: [Project DESI](http://dx.doi.org/10.7477/6:1:1), where 

* codebooks are publicly accessible (files on the right side)
* video data are restricted for scientific use (files on the bottom of page)

**Alternatives**  

* *Embargo period*
  - Specify a time period, before data go public
  - Possible with research data centers and some repositories
* *Exclude certain research questions* from reuse
  - Specify these research questions in the terms of use
  - Usually only possible with research data centers, except you are writing a very good license yourself
* Create *synthetic data* (e.g., with R package [`synthpop`](https://synthpop.org.uk/))
  - Mimics the properties of your data
  - Then possible to share this synthetic data set
