## Researchers' perceptions

Open Data Survey [@Goodey.etal.2022]

* **75%** of researchers say there is too little credit for sharing data 
* main drivers:
  - perceived **higher citation** (67%)
  - increased perceived **impact** and **visibility** (61%)

\

## Classical metrics

* Data for reuse: Additional publication (e.g., data note in F1000 Research)
* Is there higher citation?
   - studies with available data: **9%** more citations [@Piwowar.Vision.2013]
   - studies with link to data in a repository: **25%** higher citation rates [@Colavizza.etal.2020]

**But:**  
Selection bias: Willingness to share `r fontawesome::fa("arrows-left-right", height=".9em", width=".9em")` strength of evidence and quality of reporting [@Wicherts.etal.2011]

**But:**  
With higher transparency, researchers have higher trust in authors [@Schneider.etal.2022c]
