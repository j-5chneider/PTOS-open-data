E.g.,

* [Psychological Bulletin](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/bul#accordion410__content_4): Data transparency Level 2
* [Meta Psychology](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/about): Data transparency Level 3
* [Psychological Science](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/psychological_science/ps-submissions#DATA): Data transparency Level 1
