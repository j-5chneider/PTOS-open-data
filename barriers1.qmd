# Barriers

Let's assume: Sharing data is possible. In one way or the other.  
  
**Why isn't everybody sharing all data "as open as possible as closed as necessary"?**

1. Check out the [flow chart](workflow1.qmd) again
2. Individually [3min]: Reflect on 
   - What is a barrier/challenge to you?
   - What might be a powerful barrier/challenge for others?
3. In the breakout rooms [12min]: Discuss
   - What are the biggest barriers for you/others?
   - What would be different in an "ideal world" that would lead to you/others overcoming these barriers?
   - Document the barriers & your needs in [this sheet](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/WOjk7Qf9VNoXeBainrspJnpe/embed/)
