# Limits

## Not being open may be important

**When does "as closed as necessary" apply?**  
  
The protection of individuals comes first and is more important than the potential reuse of data

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Marginalized/vulnerable groups

* e.g., individuals traumatized by war or who experienced sexual abuse
* At the same time: Can sharing data help to protect these groups from being over-researched (possibly re-traumatization)?

### "Closed doors"

* cases in which field access is obstructed or denied by the data provision [@Prosser.etal.2022]
* cases in which sharing reduces the reduces the willingness to participate


### Costs > benefit

* e.g., low reuse potential -> publish for reproducibility
* e.g., when obtaining permission from the school authorities is extremely complicated 
* e.g., epistemic problem: context of data collection is highly relevant and other researchers "haven't been there" [@Mauthner.etal.1998] -> publish for intersubjective comprehensibility
* e.g., can't anonymize data -> synthpop, create input-output-documents via RMarkdown/Quarto

## It's not all your responsibility

* Responsibility of opening research is a **collective responsibility** in the **"research ecosystem"** [@EuropeanCommission.2018; @RfII.2019]
* Researchers are just one part of this

### Infrastructure

* Does suitable infrastructure exist?
* Is it "easy to use" and cheap?
* Is it tailored to my needs and type of data?
* Does it allow the implementation of FAIR data?
* Are there resources to support data sharing?

### Context

* Do scientific societies, journals, or research funders encourage sharing?
* Is it common practice ("culture") in my field of research to share data? [@Bishop.2006]
* Are there standards established for data sharing?
* Do ethics committees request detailed reasoning for the intent to collect own data as opposed to re-using?

### Research project

See reasons above on

* Marginalized/vulnerable groups
* "Closed doors"
* Costs > benefit

:::
::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
### Researchers

* Willingness and concerns toward sharing data [@Mozersky.etal.2021]
* Knowledge, experiences and skills with relevant processes
